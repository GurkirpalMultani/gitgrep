# gitgrep

[git|grep](http://gitgrep.me) is a single page website made with love, by hackers for hackers. It helps to find secrets on GitHub using his API.
Unfortunately that means that we have to deal with the restrictions in place.

This webservice is my contribution to the security industry, if you like it, you can support my work.
